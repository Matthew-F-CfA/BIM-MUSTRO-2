The applications in the imagescan package can be used to create StratImages which can be
added into the MUSTRO image archives and then used in the construction kit. Just
create the StratImages then add them to the install/image/* directories then
initialize the MUSTRO kit as if nothing had been changed.
StratImages are scaled to fit a computer's platform dependent screen size at installation.

Classes:
  bim.rpg.imagescan.StratImageDrawer
    Used for drawing StratImages.

  bim.rpg.imagescan.StratImageDrawer2
    Used for drawing StratImages. Has less drawing space than StratImageDrawer because
    the north, east, south, and west edges can have other StratImages loaded into them
    for drawing images that are adjacent to each other and need to have seamless edges.

  bim.rpg.imagescan.StratImageOverlayer
    Allows several StratImages to be loaded and overlapped and then saved.

  bim.rpg.imagescan.StratImageSerializer
    Allows StratImages to be loaded and then have certain colors made translucent
    and then saved.

  bim.rpg.imagescan.StratImageToJPGConverter
    Convert StratImages to jpeg files.

  bim.rpg.imagescan.ToolkitCreateImageConverter
    Load jpegs from an URL and convert it to a StratImage.

  bim.rpg.imagescan.ToolkitCreateImageConverterFrame
    Used in conjunction with ToolkitCreateImageConverter


Detailed Instructions for bim.rpg.imagescan.StratImageDrawer, bim.rpg.imagescan.StratImageDrawer2,
and bim.rpg.imagescan.ToolkitCreateImageConverterFrame:
If you are creating images to be used in MUSTRO be sure to
create the image data file(the image data file is the file that is
identified by the second input text dialog after clicking "Convert
Image") in the MUSTRO directories:
  data/image/creature
  data/image/character
  data/image/area
  data/image/other

Creating the image data file in a different directory and moving
it to one of the data/image/* directories will not be sufficient
for installing the image and may even totally prevent installation.

Secondly the main image file(the main image file is the file that is
identified by the first input text dialog after clicking "Convert
Image") can be created in any directory, but if it is to be used
in MUSTRO it must be moved to the install/image/*/serialized/
directory that it is to be used in.

Example:
You might be creating a creature named "dragon2" and your MUSTRO
construction kit is located in the directory "c:\mustrokit" so heres what
you do.
"click" "Convert Image". The first input text dialog pops up.
Type in the name for the main image file:
  "c:\mustrokit\install\image\creature\serialized\dragon2"
"click" "Done"
if the file does not exist a new file with the name you entered is created.
Next another input text dialog pops up.
Type in the name for the image data file:
  "data\image\creature\dragon2"
"click" "Done"
if the file does not exist a new file with the name you entered is created and
then the image is converted to a StratImage ready to be installed into the
MUSTRO kit.
If the MUSTRO kit has already been installed, you will need to install the new
image into the MUSTRO kit. This is done by executing the following from the
directory where MUSTRO is installed:
  java bim.rpg.install.SingleImageInitializer
Instructions will be provided after executing the above command.



Note 2: If you are creating character StratImages for MUSTRO.
The naming convention for character StratImages in MUSTRO is specific.
There are three types of character images. The first is the "head" image.
This image is the head of the character. The second is the "body" image.
This image is the whole body of the character except for the head.
Right now MUSTRO provides support for only one "body" image.
The third is the "combined" image. This image is a "body" image combined
with a "head" image(the bim.rpg.imagescan.StratImageOverlayer can help with this part).
Multiple "head" images may be created and combined with the single "body" image.
The naming conventions are as follows:
  The "head" images must start with "bodyhead".
    Example:
      bodyheaddragon

  The only "body" image supported at this time is "bodywhole".

  The "combined" images must start with the name of the "head" image to
    be used. Then a "`" is added. Then the name of the "body" image is
    appended.
    Example:
      bodyheaddragon`bodywhole
